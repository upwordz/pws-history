# Quick Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your Site is Ready!
All configuration files have been created and your build system is working.

## 🚀 Deploy in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Get Your Database URL
You'll need your Neon PostgreSQL connection string:
1. Go to your Neon dashboard
2. Copy the connection string (starts with `postgresql://`)

### Step 2: Create Repository
```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Portland Welding Supply - Ready for deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portland-welding-supply.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up with GitHub
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your `portland-welding-supply` repository
4. Configure:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
   - **Output Directory**: `dist/public` (auto-detected)
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - **Name**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string
6. Click "Deploy"

### Step 4: Done!
Your site will be live at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## What Happens During Deployment:
